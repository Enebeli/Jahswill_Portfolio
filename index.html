                <h2>WHO IS JAHSWILL?</h2>
            </center>
                 <p>I am Enebeli Jahswill a 21 year old student of the Southern Alberta Institute Of Technology(SAIT), majoring in Web Design And Development.
                My passion for Tech started almost half a decade ago when a family friend who was a developer introduced me to the python programming
                language, and since then i have dabbled in various aspects of the Tech industry. Some of the things i have come
                to have knowledge about since my interest in Tech started are : Backend development using Python programming language(Took a self paced course on sololearn, although i didn't complete it), 
                Data Analytics using Power Bi(Took an online course/internship with <a href="https://internship5.terrahq.co/" target="_blank">sidehustle.ng</a>) and more recently
                have started gaining knowledge on languages used for web development(HTML and CSS amongst others).</p>

                 <p> One other thing i also have an interest in is Photography, although i am no expert when it comes to taking pictures, but i always try to find an opportunity to 
                capture the beauty of nature(See some of my pictures below). It is my hope that someday i will be able to 
                master the core aspects of the Tech industry and become a sought after Tech person.</p>

                    <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
                    <p>Asides being interested in the Tech industry, there are other things i enjoy doing, things like playing Table Tennis, watching movies, reading novels, listening to songs
                        and observing nature. I don't do any of these things as much as i used to, but i try to make time for them.
